This mod solves one very simple problem with the stock SAS:
it always tracks the orientation it tries to keep relative
to the universe (the stars basically). However, when launching
and re-entering spaceplanes you are more concerned with the
attitude relative to the surface. This may also be the case
when doing long gentle re-entries with DRE and/or FAR.

When active, this plugin constantly updates the orientation
SAS tries to keep for the current vessel to make it constant
relative to the surface. This can be controlled via a button
in the stock App Launcher toolbar, which can be toggled between
ON, OFF and AUTO (default). In the AUTO mode the plugin works
only in atmosphere.
